Telegram Bot With ESP8266
=============
Hi Coders,
It's amazing to start my Hardware career with telegram bot API and ESP8266. Through this project I try to depict how to control ESP8266 with telegram bot which opens to the great world of IoT.

**1 . Installing Telegram Bot Library** 
First of all download Telegram Bot library (download it from here: https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library) and add it to Arduino IDE.
**2. Configure Telegram Bot**
Install Telegram on your Laptop or Phone and search for Botfather. Through Botfather create your new bot.

From Botfather you can taken the token.
**3. Setting up the Device**
Connect ESP8266 to Arduino as shown. Connect GPIO0 to ground and reset to reset of Arduino and upload the code.

**4. The Code**
Put your wifi credentials and bot token and upload the code.

**5. Test The Working**
I here include the making and working of my project .
